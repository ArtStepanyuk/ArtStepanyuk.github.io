Those are truth, thing that i noticed first was speed and how helpful people at forums where, how easy it was to actually install system and start working with it. Antergos use pacman which is great, its simple enough to use for people with not much of experience with unix system and people that definitely know what they are doing, if you are in look for new Distro to play with i suggest Antergos.
